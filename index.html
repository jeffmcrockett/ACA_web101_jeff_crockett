        <div id="about-text">
            <p>As proud father, husband, golfer, and video game junkie, I graduated Texas State University in 2016 with a BBA in 
              Business Management. This, however, was not the beginning of my professional career. Building on a keen understanding 
              of customer support and service, significant experience helping run a couple golf courses, and the durability that comes from working construction
              in New York City, I was eager to gain responsibility and showcase my talents. <br/><br/>Fresh off my new degree, I began 
              working with a local software company designing a complex Web-app to help non-profits host multi-million dollar fundraising events. This 
              web-app was a core component of each event and its responsibilities included ticket sales, event check-in, full mobile bidding 
              item auctions, donations, checkout, credit card processing, and much, much more. We brought this software from initial design to fruition and 
              successfully implemented into the field. and I quickly became an influential member of the team, 
              understood competition in the market, and took the reigns. Assuming the role of VP of Ops, I worked as the lead sales representative, 
              lead customer support representative, team and training leader, and (we all know how small businesses work) pretty much anything else 
              that needed attention. Most importantly, I worked side by side with a fabulous developer to enhance functionality, roll out new features, and 
              respond to client needs in a timely manner. As the lead designer of the platform, my attention was quickly drawn to development. Thanks to the 
              fantastic teachers and mentors at Austin Coding Academy, I not only know how to run a company, sell and support a product, and design software 
              but I also know how to develop it. <br/><br/>Ready to hit the ground running, nothing would make me happier than to find the perfect fit 
              with your company and bring my wide range of talents to work! At the bottom of this portfolio, please find the download link for my Resumè and 
              contact information. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!</p>
